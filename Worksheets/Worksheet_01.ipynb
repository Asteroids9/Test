It is widely used in academic institutions as well as industrial enterprises. Python\u2019s scientific libraries and environments are well [documented](https://www.python.org/doc/). With large community of users, it is easy to get help. Python has great performance due to close integration with time-tested and highly optimized codes. Also, there are no license costs involved. These, together with many other reasons, make python very suitable for scientific computing. Like all programming languages, the best way to learn is by using it.
