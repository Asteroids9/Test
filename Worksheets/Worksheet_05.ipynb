    "This tutorial class is all about loop which is a fundamental programming idea commonly used in writing computer programs. A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeatedly executed until a certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number. If it hasn't, the execution returns to the first instruction in the sequence and repeats the sequence. If the condition has been reached, the execution moves to the next sequential instruction or branches outside the loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loops can often save you writing many similar lines of code and you should always try to keep an eye out in your code for repetition that may mean you can use a loop to save you time."
